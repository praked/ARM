1) While carefully going through the Cortex-M3/M4F Instruction Set Manual Looking for Branch and control Instructions
I came across section 9.3 dedicated to IT(if-then) instruction and I found there were some restrictions to the use of
'IT' instruction which were mentioned in subsection 9.3.3 titled 'Restrictions'.

2) It tells us that 'Each instruction inside the IT block must specify a condition code suffix that is either the same
or the logical inverse.' which means the instructions inside the IT/ITE block should have a condition code 
suffix 'LT' associated with it.

3) As we see that is not true for the case of 'Code1' in which the block has MOV instructions whereas 'Code2' have a condition code 
suffix 'LT' associated with instructions ADD, MOV and 'GE' with instruction SUB which is consistent with the 'IT' restrictions. Hence, only Code1
builds with 4 errors.  

4) So inorder to remove the error we must append conditional code "LT" to "MOV" instruction for "IT" part i.e 3 "MOV" Instructions following ITTTE should be
appended by "LT"and append "GE" to "MOV" instruction for "Else" part since the ELSE condition must be the inverse of the THEN condition these two fields
differ only in the LSB of the encoding.
Corrected sequence is:
ITTTE LT ; or N != V
MOVLT R3, #0x100
MOVLT R8, #0x200
MOVLT R7, #0x200
MOVGE R6, #0x200
